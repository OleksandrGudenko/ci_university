  <p>This was made for the home examination in Databases course at OAMK. <br>
    For this website I used SQL tables to store data. PHP was used as a primary <br>
    programming language for creating the website and accessing as well as updating <br>
    the SQL table. CSS was used as a final tuch to give website personality.
